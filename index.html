"answerIndex": 2,
"explanation": "Using the distance formula, we can find the distance between the two points as sqrt((7-3)^2 + (9-4)^2) = sqrt(16 + 25) = sqrt(41). Therefore, the correct option is 7."

"explanation": "The slope of a line passing through two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is given by the formula: (y2-y1)/(x2-x1). Substituting the given values, we get the slope as (7-2)/(4-1) = 5/3. Therefore, the correct option is 3."

"answerIndex": 0,
"explanation": "Since the given line is parallel to the desired line, the slopes of the two lines must be equal. Therefore, the slope of the desired line is also 3.
